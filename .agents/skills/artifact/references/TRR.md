# Reviewer Training Record (TRR)

The project's record that a reviewer training session happened: the evidence
that mitigates the "resistance to standardized reviews" risk and satisfies a
"training delivered and recorded" gateway criterion. It records one session
of the framework's training material (`TRN`); it holds project data
(stakeholder IDs, dates), so it lives in the project, not in the framework.

- **File:** `docs/sqa/reviewer-training-record.md` (one per project; add a new
  row under `## Attendees and Assessment` and a Version History row for each
  further session).
- **Create:** `new-artifact.sh TRR --file docs/sqa/reviewer-training-record.md
  --cite TRN-001=framework/process/reviewer-training.md`.
- **CrossReference:** `TRN` (the material that was taught).

## Required sections (after Metadata / Version History)

Session (material, date, facilitator, format), Attendees and Assessment
(stakeholder IDs, attended, Pass or Not yet against the assessment in the
material, and the languages the reviewer reads and the domains they know, for
example `da, en; it, medical`: the review process uses it to choose a reviewer
for a PO-language artifact), Feedback, Follow-ups (action, owner as a stakeholder ID, due).
Fill the record after the session; never before.
